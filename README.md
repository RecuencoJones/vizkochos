Because rendering a list of pods shouldn't be expensive

## Motivation

Well, [Lens](https://k8slens.dev/) is great, it covers absolutely everything I'd love about a Kubernetes UI, but it turned into a paid service which neither me or my company are willing to pay. Which sucks. But let's be honest, I'm not paying 200€ anually to get a fancy list of pods and editing manifests (which I could basically do already with [`kubectl edit`](https://gist.github.com/mordr/3c2df494c690672247c720f66f0fb613). Not when I'm paying less than 50€ anually for a fully fledged, performant IDE like Webstorm or simply free VS Code. 

Like, seriously, __200€__?

So yeah, this was a great exercise to learn Electron and put it into practice for something barely useful.
